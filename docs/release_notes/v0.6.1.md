# Version 0.6.1 (4 December 2025)

* Add a target to place points randomly within a triangle

* If the iterative two-way travel plugin encounters a proposed time that would extend
  beyond the end of a trajectory it now emits a clear error message. Previously this
  scenario would result in it reporting that it failed to converge to a solution.

* Improve detection of failed simulation tasks and stop the simulation when they occur.
