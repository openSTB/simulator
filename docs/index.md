# Introduction

The openSTB simulator is an open-source tool for simulating sonar data. It is designed
as a modular framework where each piece of the simulation is a separate plugin allowing
for easy customisation. A number of plugins are included with the simulator. At this
stage, the simulations model a scene as a collection of idealised point targets. In the
future, other simulation methods, for example using a set of facets to model a scene,
are planned.

Note that this documentation is a work in progress.
