openSTB simulation examples
===========================

The openSTB simulation framework includes a (currently very basic) CLI to load the
configuration from a file (or other source) and run it. The `cli/` subdirectory
contains some examples of using the simulator via the CLI.

The framework can also be used from your own scripts. The `scripts/` subdirectory gives
some examples of using the simulator in this manner.
